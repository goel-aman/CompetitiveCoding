// 2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock
// You are given an integer array prices representing the daily price history 
// of a stock, where prices[i] is the stock price on the ith day.
// A smooth descent period of a stock consists of one or more contiguous days
//  such that the price on each day is lower than the price on the preceding 
// day by exactly 1. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

// Return the number of smooth descent periods.

// Example 1:
// Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
// [3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
// Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.

// Example 2:
// Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
// Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 â‰  1.

// Example 3:
// Input: prices = [1]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]
 
// Constraints:
// 1 <= prices.length <= 105
// 1 <= prices[i] <= 105
