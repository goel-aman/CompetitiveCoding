// 1227. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability
// n passengers board an airplane with exactly n seats. The first passenger has lost
//  the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of passengers will:
// Take their own seat if it is still available, 
// Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied 
// What is the probability that the n-th person can get his own seat?

// Example 1:
// Input: n = 1
// Output: 1.00000
// Explanation: The first person can only get the first seat.

// Example 2:
// Input: n = 2
// Output: 0.50000
// Explanation: The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the first seat).
 
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 10^5
