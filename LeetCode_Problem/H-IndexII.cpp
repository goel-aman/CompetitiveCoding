// 275. H-Index II
// Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of
//  citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted 
// in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's h-index.
// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index 
// h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers
//  have no more than h citations each.
// If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

// Example 1:
// Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them 
// had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
// Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
// two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

// Example 2:
// Input: citations = [1,2,100]
// Output: 2
 
// Constraints:
// n == citations.length
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
// citations is sorted in ascending order.
 
// Follow up: Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
