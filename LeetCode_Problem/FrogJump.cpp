// 403. Frog Jump
// A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, 
//but it must not jump into the water.

// Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. 
//Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

// If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.

// Note:

// The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
// Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
// The first stone's position is always 0.
// Example 1:

// [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

// There are a total of 8 stones.
// The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
// third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
// The last stone at the 17th unit.

// Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
// 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
// 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
// 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
// Example 2:

// [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]

// Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as 
// the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
